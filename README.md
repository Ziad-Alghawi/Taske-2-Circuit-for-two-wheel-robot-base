Motor drive design and implementation for two-wheel robot base

First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

Two DC motors

Arduino UNO R3

9 volt battery

The Breadboard small

H-Bridge Motor Driver

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

In the beginning I reached the Ground and the Power

Next I connected the pins from the H-bridge motor driver to the Arduino UNO R3

Enable 1 & 2 Contact 8

Input 1 Contact 9

Input 2 contact pin 10.

Enable 3 and 4 contact 7

Input 3 pin contact 6

Input 4 pin contact 5


Then I wrote the code attached here

At first I defined the pins

Then I wrote the connections as shown above or in the picture
