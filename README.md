# Taske-2-Circuit-for-two-wheel-robot-base
Motor drive design and implementation for two-wheel robot base

First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

Two DC motors

Arduino UNO R3

9 volt battery

The Breadboard small

H-Bridge Motor Driver

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

In the beginning I reached the Ground and the Power

# Next I connected the pins (from the H-bridge motor driver to the Arduino)

Enable 1 & 2 connected with pin number 8

Input 1 connected with pin number 9

Input 2 connected with pin number 10.

Enable 3 and 4 connected with pin number 7

Input 3 pin connected with pin number 6

Input 4 pin connected with pin number 5


Then I wrote the code attached here

At first I defined the pins

Then I wrote the connections as shown above or in the picture
